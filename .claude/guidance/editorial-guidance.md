# Editorial guidance

## Source code context

If the target project has a `CLAUDE.md` at `{sourceDir}/CLAUDE.md`, read it for architecture, style, and conventions before writing or reviewing wiki content.

## Writing principles

- Lead with what the reader needs, not background.
- Second person ("you") — direct, conversational, professional.
- Present tense — "the method returns" not "the method will return".
- Short sentences, short paragraphs — scannable over readable.
- Sentence-case headings — not Title Case.
- Numbered steps for tasks, bullets for options.
- Self-contained pages — link to supporting concepts but include enough context for readers who never follow links.
